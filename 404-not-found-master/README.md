I had a really nice experience creating the page. It was easier than my previous projects and i took less time. It's amazing because a few months ago i was not able to position elements in the DOM. Everything was seamless thoughout the development of the page. Am really excited because i know that means am getting better. I refined my skills on CSS Positioning and used media queries. 
Am grateful for my friend Velda Kiara for introducing me to DevChallenges, it's always a pleasure working with you Velda!:).
Am looking forward to the next challenge. Stay tuned!
